# Operator-SQL
Practice SQL operator-based queries, including arithmetic (+, -, , /), comparison (&lt;, >, =, !=), logical (AND, OR, NOT), and special operators like BETWEEN, IN, LIKE, and IS NULL to filter and manipulate data effectively.

# SQL Operators Practice
# 📌 Overview
This project focuses on practicing SQL operators through real-world queries. Operators in SQL are used to perform calculations, filter data, and build conditions in queries. By mastering these, you can write efficient and dynamic SQL statements.

# 🔑 Key Topics Covered

Comparison Operators: =, <, >, <=, >=, !=

Logical Operators: AND, OR, NOT

Special Operators: BETWEEN, IN, LIKE, IS NULL

Wildcard Usage: % and _ for pattern matching

# 🎯 Objective

Understand how to combine conditions effectively.

Explore practical examples on sample tables like Employee, Department, and Products.

# 📚 Sample Questions
Find employees with a salary greater than 50,000.
